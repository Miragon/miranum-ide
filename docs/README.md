# Miranum

<hr>

We from Miragon want to shape the future of process automation.
Therefore, we created the Miranum-IDE, a process modeling IDE.
Miranum enables process developers to easily develop bpmn diagrams.
By providing a webservice that contains all necessary addons, we enable process developing in a way an IDE would support a programmer.
Some functionalities it provides are:
project creation / generation,
deployment.
